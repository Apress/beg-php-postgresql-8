Dear reader,

We'd like to thank you for purchasing the book. You've traded hard-earned money for it, and therefore we hope it serves as a valuable reference far into the future.

Enclosed in this zip file are the code examples for "Beginning PHP and PostgreSQL 8: From Novice to Professional". While this code package is intended to ease the tedium and potential for error by providing you with the code found in the book, do not presume all of the examples are going to work out of the box! You may need to change pathnames, SQL parameters, and various other items before it will execute properly.
